# LR training-HE only Baseline

This baseline is modified from the project [FHE-SI](https://github.com/dwu4/fhe-si) and implemented under the same version of HElib as in HT2ML.

If you do not install HElib under the system path (e.g., `/usr/local/`), you can copy this folder to `HETEE_LR/host` and change the path to `HETEE_LR/host/include` in Makefile.
